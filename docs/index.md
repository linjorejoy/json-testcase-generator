## Features

- Supports 4 Data Types and null value

  - `string`
  - `int`
  - `float`
  - `bool`
  - `null`

- Template based, So you can use the same template for several test cases

## How to Use

### Initializing the JSON File

To initialize all the variablesto the Application, the JSON File needs to be prepped.

You can initialize the variables by remapping then in the pattern `$variableName$`. For Example,

![JSON Example](resources/other_images/jsonexample2.svg)

In the above example there are 6 variables initialized which are marked in bright green.

> Note : For all Data Types(`string`, `int`, `float`, `bool` or `null`), enclose the mapped variables inside double quotes as shown in the above example.

You can also concatenate variables together or with other strings as shown in the below example.

### Start Page

You can select 2 paths from here.

- [Generate All Permutation](#generating-all-permutations)
- [Generate Using Table](#generating-using-table)

![StartPage](resources/other_images/startpage2.jpg)

### Uploading the JSON File

Click on the **Select File** Button and select the JSON template file that you created in your [previous step](#initializing-the-json-file).

Upload Page snapshot :

### Process Variables

This is the step where you have to define the test cases that needs to be created.

#### Generating All Permutations

It will generate all the Permutations of the variation of all the inputs provided.

For Example, assume there are `4` variables having `8, 8, 7, 8` variations respectively. Then it will create.

> 8 x 8 x 7 x 8 = 3584 different variations

**So the number of variations can increase very fast.**

> As Stan Lee (May he Rest in Peace) in his Spider Man Comics once Said [**With great power comes great responsibility**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility), you should use this method cautiously.
